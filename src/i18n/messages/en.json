          "answer": "AES-256 keys should be 32 bytes (256 bits) of random data. Our tool provides secure random key generation using the browser's cryptographically secure random number generator. In practical applications, keys should be securely stored, regularly rotated, managed using professional key management systems, and never stored in plaintext or transmitted through insecure channels."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between AES symmetric encryption and RSA asymmetric encryption?",
          "answer": "AES is symmetric encryption using the same key for encryption and decryption, offering fast encryption suitable for large amounts of data, but key distribution is challenging. RSA is asymmetric encryption using public-private key pairs where public key encrypts and private key decrypts, providing secure key distribution but slower encryption. In practice, they're often combined: RSA transmits AES keys, AES encrypts actual data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can data be decrypted if the AES key is forgotten?",
          "answer": "No. AES encryption security is based on key secrecy, and data cannot be decrypted without the correct key. This is a security feature of AES design - even the algorithm designers cannot decrypt data without knowing the key. Therefore, secure key storage and backup are crucial, and professional key management solutions are recommended."

          "answer": "Hexadecimal encoding represents byte data using 0-9 and A-F characters, with each byte represented by two hex characters. It's more compact than binary and more intuitive for representing internal computer data, widely used in memory addresses, color codes, encryption keys, and other scenarios."
        },

          "answer": "Chinese and other multi-byte characters typically occupy 3 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, with each byte converted to 2 hex characters, so one Chinese character produces 6 hex characters. This is normal encoding behavior that ensures character integrity and internationalization support."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between hex encoding and Base64 encoding?",
          "answer": "Hexadecimal uses 16 characters (0-9, A-F), with each character representing 4 bits of data, resulting in encoded length twice the original data. Base64 uses 64 characters, each representing 6 bits, resulting in about 1.33 times the original data length - more compact but slightly less readable."
        },
        {
          "question": "How to handle hexadecimal data in programming?",
          "answer": "Most programming languages have built-in hex support. JavaScript uses parseInt(hex, 16) for parsing and toString(16) for conversion. Python uses hex() and int(hex_str, 16). Hexadecimal is commonly used in bit operations, memory debugging, protocol parsing, and other low-level programming scenarios."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why must hex strings have even length?",
          "answer": "Because each byte is fixed to be represented by two hex characters, odd-length strings cannot correctly correspond to complete byte boundaries. When encountering odd length, you usually need to pad with 0 at the front or check if the data is complete."

          "question": "Why do Chinese characters produce so many binary digits?",
          "answer": "Chinese characters typically occupy 3 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, with each byte containing 8 binary digits, so one Chinese character produces 24 binary digits (3×8=24). This ensures complete representation of Chinese characters and international compatibility, which is the normal encoding method of the Unicode standard."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between binary encoding and ASCII encoding?",
          "answer": "ASCII encoding can only represent 128 basic English characters, with each character represented by 7 bits. Our binary encoding is based on UTF-8, which can represent all characters worldwide, including Chinese, emojis, etc. UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII but provides much broader character support."
        },
        {
          "question": "How to understand binary data storage in computers?",
          "answer": "All data inside computers is stored in binary form. Every 8 binary bits (0s or 1s) form one byte, which is the basic unit of computer storage. Understanding binary encoding helps understand how computers store text, images, programs, and various other data types."
        },
        {
          "question": "Must binary strings be multiples of 8?",
          "answer": "Yes, because UTF-8 encoding is byte-based, with each byte fixed at 8 bits. If the length of a binary string is not a multiple of 8, it usually indicates incomplete data or errors. We check this condition during decoding to ensure data integrity."

          "answer": "HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a message authentication code based on hash functions combined with secret keys. Unlike regular hash functions, HMAC requires a key to participate in computation, providing message integrity verification and sender identity authentication.

        },
        {
          "question": "How accurate are the conversion results?",
          "answer": "The tool uses standard color conversion algorithms to ensure result accuracy. RGB and HEX conversion is lossless. HSL to RGB conversion may have minor precision differences (typically less than 1), which can be ignored in practical use."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why don't some colors have corresponding CSS names?",
          "answer": "CSS only defines 147 standard color names (including transparent), while millions of other colors have no corresponding names. If your input color is not in the standard color list, the tool will show 'No corresponding CSS color name', but will still display HEX, RGB and HSL formats normally."

          "answer": "Dot matrix images are widely used in: 1) Retro style design, simulating early printing effects; 2) Modern art creation, producing unique visual effects; 3) Web design backgrounds and decorative elements; 4) Poster and print design; 5) Brand visual identity systems; 6) Digital art and NFT creation. Dot matrix effects can give ordinary images a unique artistic and technological feel."
        },
        {
          "question": "How to choose appropriate dot size and spacing?",
          "answer": "Dot size and spacing selection depends on the usage scenario: small images should use smaller dots (2-4 pixels), large images can use larger dots (5-10 pixels). Larger spacing makes images more abstract; smaller spacing preserves more detail. It's recommended to start with default values and fine-tune based on results. For print output, use smaller dots to retain more detail."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the differences between color modes?",
          "answer": "Three color modes each have characteristics: 1) Grayscale mode preserves image light and dark levels, suitable for scenes requiring rich detail; 2) Black and white mode has only pure black and pure white, producing high contrast effects, suitable for simple styles and logo design; 3) Color mode preserves original image colors, suitable for artistic creation and color printing. Consider final use and visual needs when choosing."
        },
        {
          "question": "How to choose between PNG and SVG formats?",
          "answer": "PNG is a bitmap format, suitable for direct use and sharing, larger files but good compatibility, suitable for web display, social media, etc. SVG is a vector format that can scale infinitely without loss, usually smaller files, suitable for scenarios requiring scaling like printing, logos, icon design. If you need post-editing or significant scaling, choose SVG; if you need quick use and sharing, choose PNG."
        },
        {
          "question": "How is performance when processing large images?",
          "answer": "The tool is performance-optimized and can smoothly process large images. Images under 10MB are recommended for best experience. For oversized images, dot size is automatically adjusted to ensure processing speed. All processing is done locally in the browser without uploading to servers, ensuring image security. If you encounter performance issues, consider resizing the image first or increasing dot size."

For academic papers, 'Total Words' (Chinese characters + English words) or 'Characters (excluding spaces)' are usually the focus. Different journals and schools may have different word count standards, so it is recommended to choose the appropriate metric based on specific requirements."

        {
          "question": "How are sentences counted?",

        {
          "question": "What is the use of UTF-8 byte count?",
          "answer": "The UTF-8 byte count reflects the actual size of the text when stored or transmitted. Chinese characters typically occupy 3 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, while English characters occupy 1 byte. This is very useful for scenarios such as database field length limits, API request size limits, and file size estimation."
