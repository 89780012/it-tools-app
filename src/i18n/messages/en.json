          "question": "Why is an Initialization Vector (IV) needed? What is its purpose?",
          "answer": "The Initialization Vector (IV) is an important security mechanism for AES-CBC mode, ensuring that even when encrypting the same plaintext with the same key, the encryption result is different each time, preventing cryptanalytic attacks. The IV doesn't need to be secret, but each encryption should use a randomly generated IV. Our tool automatically generates secure random IVs."

          "question": "How should AES keys be generated and managed?",
          "answer": "AES-256 keys should be 32 bytes (256 bits) of random data. Our tool provides secure random key generation using the browser's cryptographically secure random number generator. In practical applications, keys should be securely stored, regularly rotated, managed using professional key management systems, and never stored in plaintext or transmitted through insecure channels."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between AES symmetric encryption and RSA asymmetric encryption?",
          "answer": "AES is symmetric encryption using the same key for encryption and decryption, offering fast encryption suitable for large amounts of data, but key distribution is challenging. RSA is asymmetric encryption using public-private key pairs where public key encrypts and private key decrypts, providing secure key distribution but slower encryption. In practice, they're often combined: RSA transmits AES keys, AES encrypts actual data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can data be decrypted if the AES key is forgotten?",
          "answer": "No. AES encryption security is based on key secrecy, and data cannot be decrypted without the correct key. This is a security feature of AES design - even the algorithm designers cannot decrypt data without knowing the key. Therefore, secure key storage and backup are crucial, and professional key management solutions are recommended."

        {
          "question": "What is binary encoding and what is it used for?",
          "answer": "Binary encoding converts characters into sequences of binary digits composed of 0s and 1s. Each character is converted to 8-bit binary numbers according to its UTF-8 encoded byte values. Binary encoding is mainly used in computer science education, understanding data storage principles, low-level programming debugging, and digital circuit design."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why do Chinese characters produce so many binary digits?",
          "answer": "Chinese characters typically occupy 3 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, with each byte containing 8 binary digits, so one Chinese character produces 24 binary digits (3√ó8=24). This ensures complete representation of Chinese characters and international compatibility, which is the normal encoding method of the Unicode standard."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between binary encoding and ASCII encoding?",
          "answer": "ASCII encoding can only represent 128 basic English characters, with each character represented by 7 bits. Our binary encoding is based on UTF-8, which can represent all characters worldwide, including Chinese, emojis, etc. UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII but provides much broader character support."
        },
        {
          "question": "How to understand binary data storage in computers?",
          "answer": "All data inside computers is stored in binary form. Every 8 binary bits (0s or 1s) form one byte, which is the basic unit of computer storage. Understanding binary encoding helps understand how computers store text, images, programs, and various other data types."
        },
        {
          "question": "Must binary strings be multiples of 8?",
          "answer": "Yes, because UTF-8 encoding is byte-based, with each byte fixed at 8 bits. If the length of a binary string is not a multiple of 8, it usually indicates incomplete data or errors. We check this condition during decoding to ensure data integrity."

          "question": "What image formats does the Base64 Image Converter support?",
          "answer": "The tool supports conversion of all common image formats, including JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP and more. Regardless of format, images can be accurately converted to Base64 encoding and perfectly restored to their original form. The tool automatically detects image types and optimizes the conversion process."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the image size limitations? Why are there restrictions?",
          "answer": "For optimal conversion performance and user experience, we recommend images under 10MB. This limitation considers: 1) Browser memory usage efficiency; 2) Conversion speed and responsiveness; 3) Avoiding page freezing. For larger images, consider resizing or compressing them first."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much larger do images become after Base64 encoding?",
          "answer": "Base64 encoding increases image size by approximately 33%. This is because Base64 uses 64 printable characters to represent 256 possible byte values, with every 3 original bytes encoded as 4 Base64 characters. While the size increases, this enables transmission of binary image data in text protocols, making it ideal for CSS data URLs and web development."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the conversion process secure? Are images uploaded to servers?",
          "answer": "Completely secure! All conversion operations are performed locally in your browser, and image content never leaves your device. We do not upload, store, or record any image data. This local processing approach ensures the highest level of privacy protection, suitable for handling sensitive images and personal photos."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can I verify that the Base64 encoding after conversion is correct?",
          "answer": "You can verify through the following methods: 1) Use our Base64 to Image function for reverse verification; 2) Check if the Base64 string contains only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, = characters; 3) Verify that the string length is a multiple of 4; 4) For images, you can preview the Base64 as a Data URL in the browser to see the actual image."
