          "question": "How should I manage and store the generated passwords?",
          "answer": "We strongly recommend using professional password managers (such as 1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, etc.) to securely store passwords. Never store passwords in plain text files, emails, or notes. Password managers can also help you identify duplicate passwords and remind you to update weak passwords regularly."

AES-256 uses a 256-bit key, theoretically requiring 2^256 attempts to break, which would take billions of years even with supercomputers. It's suitable for sensitive document protection, database encryption, communication encryption, and secure file storage scenarios."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is an Initialization Vector (IV) needed? What is its purpose?",
          "answer": "The Initialization Vector (IV) is an important security mechanism for AES-CBC mode, ensuring that even when encrypting the same plaintext with the same key, the encryption result is different each time, preventing cryptanalytic attacks. The IV doesn't need to be secret, but each encryption should use a randomly generated IV. Our tool automatically generates secure random IVs."
        },

          "question": "How should AES keys be generated and managed?",
          "answer": "AES-256 keys should be 32 bytes (256 bits) of random data. Our tool provides secure random key generation using the browser's cryptographically secure random number generator. In practical applications, keys should be securely stored, regularly rotated, managed using professional key management systems, and never stored in plaintext or transmitted through insecure channels."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between AES symmetric encryption and RSA asymmetric encryption?",
          "answer": "AES is symmetric encryption using the same key for encryption and decryption, offering fast encryption suitable for large amounts of data, but key distribution is challenging. RSA is asymmetric encryption using public-private key pairs where public key encrypts and private key decrypts, providing secure key distribution but slower encryption. In practice, they're often combined: RSA transmits AES keys, AES encrypts actual data."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can data be decrypted if the AES key is forgotten?",
          "answer": "No. AES encryption security is based on key secrecy, and data cannot be decrypted without the correct key. This is a security feature of AES design - even the algorithm designers cannot decrypt data without knowing the key. Therefore, secure key storage and backup are crucial, and professional key management solutions are recommended."

          "answer": "SHA1 has been proven to have theoretical collision attack possibilities and is not recommended for new security-critical applications. However, it can still be used for file integrity checking, non-critical data identification, etc. New projects should use SHA-256 or stronger algorithms."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does Git use SHA1?",
          "answer": "Git uses SHA1 as object identifiers because SHA1 provided good distribution and low collision probability when designed. Although there are more secure algorithms now, Git's design makes accidental collisions almost impossible to affect actual usage, and changing algorithms would require huge compatibility costs."

          "answer": "Hexadecimal encoding represents byte data using 0-9 and A-F characters, with each byte represented by two hex characters. It's more compact than binary and more intuitive for representing internal computer data, widely used in memory addresses, color codes, encryption keys, and other scenarios."

          "answer": "Chinese and other multi-byte characters typically occupy 3 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, with each byte converted to 2 hex characters, so one Chinese character produces 6 hex characters. This is normal encoding behavior that ensures character integrity and internationalization support."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between hex encoding and Base64 encoding?",
          "answer": "Hexadecimal uses 16 characters (0-9, A-F), with each character representing 4 bits of data, resulting in encoded length twice the original data. Base64 uses 64 characters, each representing 6 bits, resulting in about 1.33 times the original data length - more compact but slightly less readable."
        },
        {
          "question": "How to handle hexadecimal data in programming?",
          "answer": "Most programming languages have built-in hex support. JavaScript uses parseInt(hex, 16) for parsing and toString(16) for conversion. Python uses hex() and int(hex_str, 16). Hexadecimal is commonly used in bit operations, memory debugging, protocol parsing, and other low-level programming scenarios."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why must hex strings have even length?",
          "answer": "Because each byte is fixed to be represented by two hex characters, odd-length strings cannot correctly correspond to complete byte boundaries. When encountering odd length, you usually need to pad with 0 at the front or check if the data is complete."

          "question": "What's the difference between binary encoding and ASCII encoding?",
          "answer": "ASCII encoding can only represent 128 basic English characters, with each character represented by 7 bits. Our binary encoding is based on UTF-8, which can represent all characters worldwide, including Chinese, emojis, etc. UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII but provides much broader character support."

        {
          "question": "How to understand binary data storage in computers?",
          "answer": "All data inside computers is stored in binary form. Every 8 binary bits (0s or 1s) form one byte, which is the basic unit of computer storage. Understanding binary encoding helps understand how computers store text, images, programs, and various other data types."
        },
        {
          "question": "Must binary strings be multiples of 8?",
          "answer": "Yes, because UTF-8 encoding is byte-based, with each byte fixed at 8 bits. If the length of a binary string is not a multiple of 8, it usually indicates incomplete data or errors. We check this condition during decoding to ensure data integrity."

          "answer": "Three color modes each have characteristics: 1) Grayscale mode preserves image light and dark levels, suitable for scenes requiring rich detail; 2) Black and white mode has only pure black and pure white, producing high contrast effects, suitable for simple styles and logo design; 3) Color mode preserves original image colors, suitable for artistic creation and color printing. Consider final use and visual needs when choosing."

          "question": "How to choose between PNG and SVG formats?",
          "answer": "PNG is a bitmap format, suitable for direct use and sharing, larger files but good compatibility, suitable for web display, social media, etc. SVG is a vector format that can scale infinitely without loss, usually smaller files, suitable for scenarios requiring scaling like printing, logos, icon design. If you need post-editing or significant scaling, choose SVG; if you need quick use and sharing, choose PNG."

          "question": "How is performance when processing large images?",
          "answer": "The tool is performance-optimized and can smoothly process large images. Images under 10MB are recommended for best experience. For oversized images, dot size is automatically adjusted to ensure processing speed. All processing is done locally in the browser without uploading to servers, ensuring image security. If you encounter performance issues, consider resizing the image first or increasing dot size."
